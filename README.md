This is a Data Cleaning Project in SQL using Microsoft SQL Server as the database tool.

Dataset used is of Nashville Housing, containing information about the properties in Nashville.

While executing this project, I learned and used the *Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio* to import data along with queries related to DQL, DDL and DML commands.

**Tasks performed for cleaning the data:**

* Standardize Date Format
* Populate Property Address data
* Breaking out Address into Individual Columns (Address, City, State)
* Spliting Owner Address
* Change Y and N to Yes and No in "Sold as Vacant" field
* Remove Duplicates
* Delete Unused Columns

Thanks to *Alex Freberg (AlexTheAnalyst)* for the invaluable guidance.
